This program will populate an array with the above 7-segment encodings 
as well as a second array with the bitwise inverse to be used for common-anode dispays.
For the lab, students only need to generate the common-cathode output 
BUT should also be able to explain how they would enode the common-anode decoder.
This is one way, and the easier option. Students can also define the encoding for common-anode
as done above.
